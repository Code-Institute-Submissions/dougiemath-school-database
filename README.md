# Student Database

## Project Description
Students who join an 'English as a Second Language (ESL)' school will do a test on arrival to ascertain the student's level of English, and thus be placed in the correct classroom.  This project is to enable langauge schools to enter a new student onto a spreadsheet, enter the student's test results, calculate the student's level and allocate the student a unique student number.  Specific students are searchable (by student ID) and removable.
## UX Design
### User Stories
As a first time user, I want:
* an easy to understand interface with minimal options
* to be led through each process by the program
* to be able to return to the main menu easily

As a returning/frequent user, I want:
* to be able to find/remove students quickly
