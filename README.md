# Student Database

## Project Description
Students who join an 'English as a Second Language (ESL)' school will do a test on arrival to ascertain the student's level of English, and thus be placed in the correct classroom.  This project is to enable langauge schools to enter a new student onto a spreadsheet, enter the student's test results, calculate the student's level and allocate the student a unique student number.  Specific students are searchable (by student ID) and removable.

## UX Design

![Responsive View](assets/images/responsive.jpg)

### User Stories

As a first time user, I want:
* an easy to understand interface with minimal options
* to be led through each process by the program
* to be able to return to the main menu easily

As a returning/frequent user, I want:
* to be able to find/remove students quickly

### Site Owner's Goals

As the owner of this program, I wanted to:
* create a program that is simple to follow
* create a program that allows users to store data on a Google Sheet by using the Google Drive and Google Sheets APIs
* add students individually
* use logic to calculate the student's level
* automatically generate a unique student number for each new student
* create a search function to display single students
* display every student stored on the spreadsheet
* remove individual students
* remove all students

### Structure

## Features

### Existing Features

#### Main Menu

![main menu](assets/images/school_database_screenshots/menu.jpg)

Users have 6 options to choose from.  The menu was centred to make it eye-catching and simple to read.

#### Add New Student

![Add New Student](assets/images/school_database_screenshots/add_new_student.jpg)

Users can enter a new student's details: family name, first name, nationality, age, test result, course start date, and course end date.  (Nationality was include as students in a langauge school are normally divided by language in order to force the student to use the target language more than their native)

![Calculate Level and Student ID](assets/images/school_database_screenshots/add_new_student_calculate_level_and_ID.jpg)

Users do not need to enter the student's level as the programme will calculate it automatically based on the [CEFR](https://www.coe.int/web/common-european-framework-reference-languages/level-descriptions).

User also do not need to allocate a Student ID as this will be generated by the programme.

![Add Student to Database](assets/images/school_database_screenshots/add_new_student_update_spreadsheet.jpg)

New students will be added to a Google Spreadsheet that the user does not have/need access to.

Users will also be able to add another new student without needing to return to the main menu.

#### Search for Student

![Search](assets/images/school_database_screenshots/search_for_student.jpg)

Users will be able to search for students by their ID number.  This was designed to emulate a student handing over a 'Student Card' and the user searching using the number that would be present - similar to a university's matriculation number.

Users will be able to search for other students without returning to the main menu.

#### Display all students

![Display all students](assets/images/school_database_screenshots/display_all_students.jpg)

Users will be able to see all of the students on the database, and all of the information stored on each one.  

#### Delete Student

![Delete Student](assets/images/school_database_screenshots/delete_student.jpg)

Users will be able to remove single students.  The search is similar to the 'Search for Student' feature, where the student can only be found by using the ID.  This removes the potential removal of a student with the same name.

![Delete Student Confirmation](assets/images/school_database_screenshots/delete_student_confirmation.jpg)

Users will be given a confirmation screen to ensure that they have the correct student.

Users will be able to delete other students without returning to the main menu.

#### Reset Database

![Reset Database](assets/images/school_database_screenshots/reset_database.jpg)

Users will be able to clear the entire spreadsheet.

![Reset Database Confirmation](assets/images/school_database_screenshots/reset_database_confirmation.jpg)

Users will be given a confirmation screen to ensure that they really want to do this.

### Features Left to Implement
In order to make this program more user friendly to the target audience (shcool administration dept), the ability to export the database (either as a whole or for individual student) to a printable format - such as a PDF.  

## Technologies Used

### Language

[Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) - The entire project was written in Python 3

### Other Tools/Programs

[GSpread](https://docs.gspread.org/en/latest/) - for storing the 'student database' on an accessible spreadsheet

[GitHub](https://github.com/) - for storing my code in a public repository

[Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/) - for creating my code and pushing to GitHub

[Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) - for deploying my code and generating a 'live' link for users as GitHub does not support this style of programming

[Draw.io](https://www.draw.io/) - to create the flowchart for the programme's structure


## Testing

### Validation
PEP8 Validation - http://pep8online.com/

![PEP8 Validation Results](assets/images/pep8_validation_results.jpg)

### Known Bugs fixed

During development, there were many bugs that I faced but fixed by inserting print statements throughout.  However the following bugs required further research and/or help from my mentor.

* When adding a new student, it was possible to set the student's age to zero.
    * An addition to the 'IF' statement was added to ensure that '0' would be raised as an error

* When the user input was being validated, the error message was being raised twice
    * This was due to calling a function twice - validate_data function now only called from within 'IF' statement

* Code was too long due to each comment taking up a minimum of 5 lines each
    * single function (display_message) created to be called when an error needs to be displayed

* PEP8 raised 'if values.isalpha() == False' should be 'if values.isalpha() is False'
    * Fixed accordingly

### Bugs remaining
In the 'Add New Student' section the user has can enter a 'Start Date' and an 'End Date' using the format 'DD-MM-YYYY'.  If the user uses a different input (such as DD/MM/YYYY) an error will be raised.  However, if the user uses the wrong format for either the 'Start Date', 'End Date' or both the error is only raised AFTER the 'End Date' is entered.
